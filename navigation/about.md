<style>
    /* Style looks pretty compact, 
       - grid-container and grid-item are referenced the code 
    */

        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); /* Dynamic columns */

        width: 100%;

        object-fit: contain; /* Ensure the image fits within the fixed height */
    }
    .grid-item p {
        margin: 5px 0; /* Add some margin for spacing */
