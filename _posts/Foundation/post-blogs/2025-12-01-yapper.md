## Mateo's Journey so far

Yo wasssssup This and I MEAN THIS... is a certified hood classic 😎😎😎
It's my blog post of my Journey with my tools!!! 🤪

This visual help remind me of Tools and their relationship to my Development Journey

Alright so let's cover this chronological order

1. The chromebook era 💻

Okay so here I was starting the class and doing some simple non commital-ish work on a chrome book 💻 for example...

    Using the browser version of vscode 
    Making github accounts, editing settings, creating issues, and repositories, ones that actually work using jm1021's template
    Learning and focusing tons on open coding society

2.  The Transitional era 🌪️

Aqui, yo estava comiendo mi culo, pero, oh lo siento I was speaking spanish, anyways, here, en este tiempo ... AAAAAA I was transitioning from my chromebook 💻 to the class supplied EliteBook 💻 I faced many troubles such as

Realizing what my actual password is 
Downloading goods and services
Downloading and using desktop vscode
Figuring out important things for the terminal on ubuntu and mainly getting the teacher to work on it
Realizing how I can use Chatgpt on firefox
Doing Terminal work in the vscode terminal thanks to a random student, so now I can access the local host which let's me test deployments before putting them into github
Realizing what other massive paragraphs are on the week by week guide of this class on OCS

3. The Modern era 🤖🤲

Basically you're all caught up now and I feel good but I have questions, and proof of knowledge statements I want to give

When will we get into actually creating code instead of text, will you teach us properly 
Github has many collaborative and storage based uses which are very important
I want to learn more about the terminal's they're important but I got help with them but I want to understand them myself
